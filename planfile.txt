# Plan File for Autocoder

Version: 0.1

## Project Vision
- Provide an intelligent, conversational coding assistant capable of research, planning, file/terminal execution, code generation, error analysis, and review.

## Core Agents
- Gemini: Conversation, researching repos, planning, updating planfile.txt, error analysis.
- Qwen: Code generation, file + CLI actions, code review/implementation.
- Human: Approval checkpoint for major changes.

## File Structure (Initial)
- main.py: CLI entry point and loop.
- gemini_agent.py: Orchestrates all plan-related logic.
- qwen_agent.py: External model interface and file operations.
- planfile.txt: This file, auto-updated.
- requirements.txt: Dependencies.

## Next Steps
1. Scaffold the above files.
2. Implement logic in Gemini agent to read, write, and update planfile.txt after every major action or conversation.
3. Enable Qwen agent to consume planfile.txt to drive coding actions.

## Update Log
- [Timestamp] Project initialized, scaffold created.

# Plan File for Autocoder - Modular Architecture

Version: 0.2

## Project Vision
Building a modular AI coding assistant with 8 distinct modules for maintainability and testing.

## Module Breakdown
1. Core Infrastructure & Plan Management
2. Gemini Agent & Research System  
3. Qwen Agent & Code Generation
4. CLI & Terminal Integration
5. Human Approval Workflow
6. Error Detection & Correction
7. IDE Extension Interface
8. Orchestrator & Main Loop

## Development Approach
- Build module by module
- Test each module independently
- Integrate incrementally
- Maintain backwards compatibility

## Current Focus
Ready to begin Module 1: Core Infrastructure & Plan Management

## Next Steps
1. Create core directory structure
2. Implement plan_manager.py
3. Set up configuration management
4. Test plan file operations

## Update Log
- [2025-08-03] Switched to modular architecture approach
- [2025-08-03] Defined 8-module structure with clear responsibilities
